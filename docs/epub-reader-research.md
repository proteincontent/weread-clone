## Recommendation

### Primary Choice: epub.js

**Reasoning**:
- Best balance of features and performance
- Wide community support and documentation
- Proven in production environments
- Adequate for most WeRead clone requirements
- MIT license allows for commercial use

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Use epub.js core with custom React wrapper
2. Implement custom reading progress tracking
3. Add bookmarking and annotation features
4. Optimize for mobile performance
5. Create custom UI components for reading settings

### Secondary Choice: EpubReader

**Reasoning**:
- Better React integration out of the box
- TypeScript support
- Simpler API for basic needs
- Good for rapid prototyping

**Use Case**:
- If epub.js proves too complex for initial implementation
- If development timeline is constrained
- For simpler EPUB rendering needs

### Implementation Considerations

#### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy load chapters as needed
- Implement virtual scrolling for long chapters
- Cache rendered content to improve navigation
- Use Web Workers for intensive processing

#### Mobile Considerations
- Implement touch gestures for navigation
- Optimize for smaller screens
- Ensure responsive design
- Test on various mobile devices

#### Accessibility
- Ensure proper ARIA labels
- Support screen readers
- Keyboard navigation
- High contrast mode support

#### Security
- Sanitize EPUB content to prevent XSS
- Validate EPUB structure before rendering
- Implement content security policies

## Next Steps

1. Create a proof of concept with epub.js
2. Implement basic reading functionality
3. Add bookmarking and progress tracking
4. Optimize for mobile devices
5. Test with various EPUB files
6. Evaluate performance and make adjustments
