# WeRead Clone - Day 1 Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the completed work for Day 1 of the WeRead clone project, focusing on requirements analysis, technology selection, and deployment setup.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ D1-1: Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Created detailed wireframes for the three main interfaces:

1. **Book Library Interface** ([docs/wireframes/book-library.md](wireframes/book-library.md))
   - Header with logo and search
   - Navigation menu with categories
   - Book grid layout with cover images, titles, and authors
   - Action buttons for transferring books and login
   - Responsive design considerations for desktop, tablet, and mobile

2. **Reader Interface** ([docs/wireframes/reader.md](wireframes/reader.md))
   - Clean reading area with minimal distractions
   - Navigation controls for chapters and pages
   - Reading settings (font size, theme)
   - Bookmark and table of contents access
   - Format-specific features for EPUB, PDF, and TXT

3. **User Profile Interface** ([docs/wireframes/user-profile.md](wireframes/user-profile.md))
   - User information and avatar display
   - Reading statistics (books read, reading time, streak)
   - Personal book collection with progress indicators
   - Settings and preferences management
   - Data visualization for reading activity

### ✅ D1-2: Technology Stack & Backup Plans

Documented comprehensive technology decisions in [docs/technology-stack.md](technology-stack.md):

**Core Technologies (Already Implemented):**
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui component library
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL (Supabase) and SQLite

**Additional Technologies Selected:**
- EPUB Reader: epub.js (primary) with EpubReader as backup
- PDF Reader: react-pdf (primary) with PDF.js as backup
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- State Management: Zustand
- File Upload: react-dropzone
- Real-time Features: Socket.io
- Image Processing: Sharp

**Backup Plans:**
- Alternative libraries for each major component
- Performance optimization strategies
- Scalability considerations

### ✅ D1-3: High-Fidelity Figma (Optional)

Marked as optional for future implementation when time permits.

### ✅ D1-4: Vercel Deployment Configuration

Set up deployment infrastructure:

1. **Vercel Configuration** ([vercel.json](../vercel.json))
   - Next.js build settings
   - Environment variables configuration
   - Function timeout settings
   - Routing configuration

2. **Deployment Guide** ([docs/deployment.md](deployment.md))
   - Step-by-step deployment instructions
   - Environment variables setup
   - Database configuration
   - Monitoring and troubleshooting
   - Security considerations

## Research & Evaluation

### EPUB Reader Libraries

Comprehensive evaluation in [docs/epub-reader-research.md](epub-reader-research.md):

**Recommendation: epub.js**
- Best balance of features and performance
- Wide community support and documentation
- Proven in production environments
- MIT license allows for commercial use

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Custom React wrapper for epub.js
- Reading progress tracking
- Bookmarking and annotation features
- Mobile performance optimization

### PDF Reader Libraries

Detailed analysis in [docs/pdf-reader-research.md](pdf-reader-research.md):

**Recommendation: react-pdf**
- Built specifically for React with TypeScript support
- Leverages PDF.js's robust rendering engine
- Simplified API compared to raw PDF.js
- Good documentation and community support

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Core PDF viewing with react-pdf
- Page navigation and zoom controls
- Reading progress tracking
- Mobile optimization

## Current Project State

### Existing Infrastructure
- ✅ Next.js 15 with TypeScript configured
- ✅ Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui set up
- ✅ Prisma ORM with both SQLite and PostgreSQL
- ✅ Basic book library UI with BookCard component
- ✅ Project structure and configuration files

### New Additions
- ✅ Comprehensive wireframes for all main interfaces
- ✅ Technology stack documentation with backup plans
- ✅ EPUB and PDF reader library research
- ✅ Vercel deployment configuration
- ✅ Deployment guide and troubleshooting

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Day (Day 2)
- Implement project structure improvements
- Set up ESLint/Prettier/Husky
- Install and verify core libraries (router, epub/pdf demo)
- Initialize Storybook (optional)

### Future Considerations
- Database design and implementation
- Authentication system setup
- EPUB and PDF reader implementation
- User profile and reading progress tracking
- Social features and recommendations

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: EPUB/PDF Reader Selection
- **Issue**: Many libraries available with varying features and performance
- **Solution**: Comprehensive evaluation based on project requirements
- **Decision**: epub.js for EPUB, react-pdf for PDF

### Challenge 2: Deployment Configuration
- **Issue**: Need for production-ready deployment with environment variables
- **Solution**: Vercel configuration with comprehensive deployment guide
- **Decision**: Vercel for seamless Next.js integration

### Challenge 3: Technology Stack Backup Plans
- **Issue**: Need for contingency plans if selected technologies don't meet needs
- **Solution**: Documented alternatives for each major component
- **Decision**: Primary choices with clear backup strategies

## Key Decisions

1. **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15 (already implemented)
   - Server-side rendering and static generation
   - Built-in API routes
   - Excellent TypeScript support

2. **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (already implemented)
   - Accessible components by default
   - Easy customization with Tailwind
   - No component lock-in

3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Supabase
   - Full-featured relational database
   - Additional services (auth, storage)
   - Excellent scalability

4. **EPUB Reader**: epub.js
   - Best balance of features and performance
   - Wide community support
   - Proven in production

5. **PDF Reader**: react-pdf
   - React-specific implementation
   - TypeScript support
   - Leverages PDF.js rendering engine

6. **Deployment**: Vercel
   - Excellent Next.js integration
   - Automatic scaling
   - Preview deployments

## Conclusion

Day 1 successfully established the foundation for the WeRead clone project:

1. **Clear Vision**: Detailed wireframes for all main interfaces
2. **Technology Stack**: Selected technologies with backup plans
3. **Deployment Ready**: Vercel configuration and deployment guide
4. **Research Complete**: EPUB and PDF reader libraries evaluated
